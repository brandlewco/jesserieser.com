MY NAME IS JESSE RIESER
AND I AM A STUDENT OF SUBTLETIES.

Since I was 17 I have been looking through a lens, making images filled with telling details and compelling characters.

But back to those subtleties. They are different from details.

Subtleties are the stuff of stories. They are the unexplained elements, the unobvious expression, the unclear artifacts. They are the lingering mysteries in the photograph that refuse to reveal themselves to the viewer immediately. My work inspires engagement, drawing in the viewer, causing him to wonder about the subjects and the stories they have to tell.

Photography is all about the moment – button pressed, instant captured. But that moment can take an hour, a day, a lifetime to happen. I engage with subjects. I understand and communicate with clients. I can see their vision through my own eyes.

Some call it empathy. Some call it charm. My mom just says I’m a nice young man.
