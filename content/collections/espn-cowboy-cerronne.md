He appeared calm, gracious, funny, and at peace with this stage of his career and the “biggest fight of his life.”\n\nConceptually my goal was to create a portfolio of intimate portraits paired with studies of Cowboy’s injuries- tightly framed and appearing larger than life as abstractions of an anatomical landscape. It was an unexpected bonus that his 18 month old son “Danger” wanted to be a part of the project. His involvement and embrace with his father nicely bridges the gap between the landscape-like injury studies and portraits, leaving the viewer with a sense of intimate masculinity."
