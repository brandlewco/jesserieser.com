collection_content = "Ever wonder about the computers which guided the Apollo moon landing 50 years ago today? One was unknowingly purchased in a Nasa garage sale by Texas resident Jimmie Loocke (purple polo.) I headed to Silicon Valley for The Wall Street Journal to photograph a group of amateur tech anthropologists as they began a two week at-home refurbishing project to get Loocke’s Apollo Guidance Computer (ACG) up and running.\n\n⁠⠀\n\nThese moonshot machines were the world’s first general-purpose, portable, digital computers, the first to fly and the first on which human lives directly depended. If all went well, the group would run the computer programs that, a half-century ago, put astronauts on the moon.⁠⠀⁠⠀\n\n⁠⠀\n\nBarely two dozen Apollo onboard computers remain in museums or private hands. According to computer historians, no one has turned one on in generations."
