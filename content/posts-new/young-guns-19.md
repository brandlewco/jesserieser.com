  Being asked to be a part of the Young Guns jury is both humbling and
  inspiring. As a past winner and 3-time judge, I am always blown away by the
  level of work being produced by the next generation. In it’s 19th year, the
  _One Clubs Young Guns_ competition recognizes the world’s best working in
  film, photography, advertising, illustration, graphic design, animation,
  architecture, typography, music, and sound design age 30 and under.


  For the annual _The New Procrastinator’s Guid to Entering Young Guns_ judges
  Gemma O’brien, Amber Vittoria, Sekani Solomon, Kellie Cambpell-Illingworth,
  Chad Michael Joyce N. Ho, Wendy W. Fok, Brian Gartside, and I share our
  insights to preparing entries and thoughts on procrastination. Head here to
  read the full article and see my contribution bellow.


  Winners will be unveiled on October 27th and will be celebrated at Sony Hall
  in New York City on Wednesday, November 17th.

  consistency. I want to be able to look at work and immediately say “That looks
  like the work of so and so.” Second is to think about the uniqueness of you.
  Think about how only you see the world the way you do; this is your most
  valuable currency. These sensibilities should consistently spill into both
  your client and personal works. I will always value a fresh and unique point
