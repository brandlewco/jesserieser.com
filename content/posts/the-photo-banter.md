We cover a range of topics from my past to current works, my photographic philosophies, and navigating both the art and the commissioned audience of the industry. We also touch on something I have been thinking a lot about lately- time as a medium... Conceptually, technically, and thematically. ⁠⁠\n\nIt was such an honor to join an impressive list of peers, mentors, and photographic legends. \n\nIn addition to the above interview, podcasts are available on [**_iTunes_**](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jesse-rieser/id1315846850?i=1000513097100), [**_Spotify_**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/653I69hF3iixGSeBWwynkn?si=-p_Uo4mDTTqFGVizqUc8-A), and [**_Soundcloud_**](https://soundcloud.com/thephotobanter/jesse-rieser).\n\n> _On today’s podcast I speak with photographer Jesse Rieser. Jesse Has worked with clients such as ESPN, Coca Cola, Esquire, The NBA, and Adidas to name a few. In this interview I speak to Jesse about his recent cover shoot with NBA player Devin Booker for ESPN , I also speak to Jesse about his approach to assignment work and how he balances the worlds of Art & Commerce. I’ve always enjoyed Jesse’s use of color in his photographs so I was excited to get a chance to speak with him about his recent project titled “Phoenix : A Dystopian Legoland that tastes Like Candy” which is a series of urban landscape photos and portraits that utilize color and space in a unique way. Jesse brings a wealth of knowledge and experience in the photographic industry so I was pumped to get a chance to speak with him about his journey with photography so I hope you enjoy and thanks for listening._"
