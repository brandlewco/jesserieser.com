I was honored to join an impressive list of peers and roster mates (Elizabeth Weinberg, Romona Rosales, Clay Patrick McBride, Justin Bettman) mentors (Chris Buck), and photographic legends (Dan Winters, Todd Hido, and Greggory Crewdson).\n\nWe cover a range of topics from my past to current works, my photographic philosophies, and navigating both the art and the commissioned audience of the industry. We also touch on something I have been thinking a lot about lately- time as a medium... Conceptually, technically, and thematically. ⁠⁠\n\nIn addition to the above interview, podcasts are available on [**_iTunes_**](applewebdata://070D4C19-2D6C-4F8F-A814-0265BF576DEB/I%20recently%20had%20the%20pleasure%20of%20sitting%20down%20with%20Alex%20Gagne%20for%20The%20Photo%20Banter.%20I%20was%20honored%20to%20join%20an%20impressive%20list%20of%20peers%20and%20roster%20mates%20(Elizabeth%20Weinberg,%20Romona%20Rosales,%20Clay%20Patrick%20McBride,%20Justin%20Bettman)%20mentors%20(Chris%20Buck),%20and%20photographic%20legends%20(Dan%20Winters,%20Todd%20Hido,%20and%20Greggory%20Crewdson).%20%20%20We%20cover%20a%20range%20of%20topics%20from%20my%20past%20to%20current%20works,%20my%20photographic%20philosophies,%20and%20navigating%20both%20the%20art%20and%20the%20commissioned%20audience%20of%20the%20industry.%20We%20also%20touch%20on%20something%20I%20have%20been%20thinking%20a%20lot%20about%20lately-%20time%20as%20a%20medium...%20Conceptually,%20technically,%20and%20thematically.%20%E2%81%A0%E2%81%A0%20%20In%20addition%20to%20the%20above%20interview,%20podcasts%20are%20available%20on%20iTunes,%20Spotify,%20and%20Soundcloud.), [**_Spotify_**](https://open.spotify.com/show/7tGIEpY38SC7kHTzIODESh?si=yN1KAbB5R2OUrIsgthaQkg), and [**_Soundcloud_**](https://soundcloud.com/thephotobanter/jesse-rieser)."
