content = "Last week I started to see Christmas lights find their way back on to residential homes as a sign of cheer and hope amid the pandemic. I liked the idea of \"Merry quarantine.\" [**_Christmas In America: Happy Birthday, Jesus_**](https://jesserieser.com/projects/christmas-in-america/) at the core is about the annual escape and a unifying event by way of nostalgic ritual. A reoccurring comfort where many find joy in the exercise of looking forward coupled with memories of holidays past. Similar to now- we stay patient and too search for solace in looking both to the future and past.\n\nWith the downtime I realized that I hadn’t shared any of this past season’s features. 2019 was the final chapter as I focused on New York City and surrounding areas.\n\nSelected features are as follows:  \n1-5: _Chaeg Issue 52_. South Korea  \n6-7: _Wings Magazine_. Germany  \n8: _Geo Magazine_. Germany  \n9\\. _Amtrak the Nationa_l. US⁠⠀"
