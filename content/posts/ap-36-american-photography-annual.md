content = "I am honored to share that [**_The Internet Giant Who Went Too_**](https://jesserieser.com/collections/wired-magazine/ ) Far for _Wired_ has been named one of the yearâ€™s best by the [**_American Photography 36 Annual **](https://www.ai-ap.com/slideshow/AP/36/?status=selected#267)for editorial photography.\n\nPublished in the July / August 2019 issue, I photographed Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin as they await trial for owning the online classified giant Backpage.com. Backpage was the red-light district of the internet or the Google of commercial sex ads, and for this both men face life in prison. As they await trial they are under country arrest and cannot travel.\n\nPhotographically I wanted to portray Lacey and Larkin in a way that spoke to their decades of defiance, possible incarceration, the shadowy space in which Backpage operated, and their physical and psychological imprisonment as they are confined to their homes and Maricopa County. In hindsight, these works take on new meaning as we have been participating in our own levels of compliance and isolation.  \n[**Article**](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-backpage-vicious-battle-feds/) by Christine Biedermann and assigned by Beth Holzer and Anna Alexander.\n\nCongratulations to all the winners and thank you to this year's judges:  \nAeriel Brown, Photo Director, _Bloomberg Businessweek_  \nLaura Geiser, Freelance Photo Producer and Editor  \nTara Guertin, Director of Photography _AFAR_  \nMolly Roberts, Independent Photography Editor, Visual Storyteller and Curator  \nJolie Ruben, Culture Photo Editor, _The New York Times_  \nDavid Sleight, Design Director, ProPublica"
