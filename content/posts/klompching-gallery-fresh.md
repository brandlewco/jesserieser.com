content = "[_The_ _Changing_ _Landscape_ _of American Retail_](https://jesserieser.com/projects/changing-landscape-american-retail/) is on display through October 10th in the annual Fresh exhibition at [Klompching Gallery](https://www.klompching.com/about). The gallery has arranged a zoom panel with owners Debra Klompching and Darren Ching with virtual artist talks with myself and artist [Marcus Desieno](http://www.marcusdesieno.com/recognition-patterns) and you can register through eventbrite [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fresh-2020-artist-talk-marcus-desieno-and-jesse-rieser-tickets-119802868605).\n\nNow in its 9th year, the FRESH Annual Exhibition is presented by the Klompching Gallery in New York. Only 5 photographers are selected for this exemplary exhibition, curated and presented to the highest standards by one of the leading contemporary art galleries, specializing in the exhibition and sale of emerging, mid-career and established artists working in the photographic arts.\n\nBeginning in 2015, The Changing Landscape of American Retail is an ongoing documentation of the shift from traditional brick-and-mortar locations where we once socialized and interacted with our community to the stark and generic essential for e-commerce. Like memories, familiar retail entities are fading away. Today, they stand as modern-day ruins and architectural artifacts.\n\nThese works are an exercise of looking to the past and peering into the future, serving as a metaphor of how technology is accelerating cultural change in the modern world. I know you can’t fight change, but that doesn’t mean you can’t be sentimental.\n\nCelebrated in the _PDN Photo Annual_ and _Photolucida’s_ _Critical Mass_, you can learn more by visiting interviews on [_The Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/photography/2019/11/22/photographing-retail-apocalypse/)_,_ [_NPR_](https://kjzz.org/content/708344/changing-face-retail-through-camera-lens)_,_ [_Architectural Digest_](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/jesse-rieser-retail-apocalypse)_,_ [_Wired_](https://www.wired.com/story/photo-gallery-retail-apocalypse/)_,_ [_Fast Company_](https://www.fastcompany.com/90230234/the-retail-apocalypse-in-pictures)_,_ and [_Business Insider_](https://www.businessinsider.com/retail-apocalypse-american-landscape-jesse-rieser-photos-2018-12)_._"
