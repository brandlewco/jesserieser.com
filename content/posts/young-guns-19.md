content = "Being asked to be a part of the Young Guns jury is both humbling and inspiring. As a past winner and 3-time judge, I am always blown away by the level of work being produced by the next generation. In it’s 19th year, the _One Clubs Young Guns_ competition recognizes the world’s best working in film, photography, advertising, illustration, graphic design, animation, architecture, typography, music, and sound design age 30 and under.\n\nFor the annual _The New Procrastinator’s Guid to Entering Young Guns_ judges Gemma O’brien, Amber Vittoria, Sekani Solomon, Kellie Cambpell-Illingworth, Chad Michael Joyce N.

I have had the honor of jurying three winning classes and I want to help position yourself to stand out in a hyper-competitive field._\n>\n> _When compiling your entry, my first point of advice is stylistic consistency. I want to be able to look at work and immediately say “That looks like the work of so and so.” Second is to think about the uniqueness of you. Think about how only you see the world the way you do; this is your most valuable currency. These sensibilities should consistently spill into both your client and personal works. I will always value a fresh and unique point of view over awards and high-profile client work with stylistic inconsistencies.
