content = "Being asked to be a part of the Young Guns jury is both humbling and inspiring. As a past winner and 3-time judge, I am always blown away by the level of work being produced by the next generation. In it’s 19th year, the One Clubs Young Guns competition recognizes the world’s best working in film, photography, advertising, illustration, graphic design, animation, architecture, typography, music, and sound design age 30 and under.\n\nFor the annual _The New Procrastinator’s Guid to Entering Young Guns_ judges Gemma O’brien, Amber Vittoria, Sekani Solomon, Kellie Cambpell-Illingworth, Chad Michael Joyce N. Ho, Wendy W. Fok, Brian Gartside, and I share our insights to preparing entries and thoughts on procrastination. Head here to read the full article and see my contribution bellow.\n\nWinners will be unveiled on **October 27th** and will be celebrated at Sony Hall in New York City on **Wednesday, November 17th**.\n\n_The New Procrastinator’s Guide to Entering Young Guns  \nJesse Rieser  \nPhotographer  \nYG9 Winner  \nYG19 Judge_\n\nIf you don’t procrastinate, there is a strong chance we can’t be friends (half joking. sorta). I’ve procrastinated as long as I can remember. And at every stage. Elementary school book reports, university term papers, client deadlines, grant proposals… all of it. Look, I get it. Besides, everything is a little spicier when the clock is ticking, and the pressure is on.\n\nBut don’t let my fondness of chaos come off as an endorsement to craft an entry in disarray. I have had the honor of jurying three winning classes and I want to help position yourself to stand out in a hyper-competitive field.\n\nWhen compiling your entry, my first point of advice is stylistic consistency. I want to be able to look at work and immediately say “That looks like the work of so and so.” Second is to think about the uniqueness of you. Think about how only you see the world the way you do; this is your most valuable currency. These sensibilities should consistently spill into both your client and personal works. I will always value a fresh and unique point of view over awards and high-profile client work with stylistic inconsistencies. Embrace your vision and push your creative currency, the awards and clients will come later. And often."
