With the use of light and bleached color, Rieser constructs an illusionistic existence where the lines between fact and fiction are blurred._\n\n_For his exhibition Souvenirs From Paradise, Jesse intertwines divergent narratives to find meaning in the meaningless. The familiar becomes foreign in his examination of our rituals and the artifacts we leave behind. One-time paradisal places are framed by our modern anxieties about the past, present, and future. Intentionally omitted information evokes a sense of absence or loss and illuminates the surreal in our surroundings._\n\n_Jesse was born in the Ozarks and attended Arizona State University, where he majored in photography and art history while attending the Herberger Institute of Art and Design. His work has been profiled by The New York Times, NPR, Washington Post, Wired, and NatGeo. He has been recognized by Communication Arts and AP Annual, and is a Critical Mass top 50 artist (awarded three times), a One Club Young Gun, a Magenta Foundation Flash Forward recipient, and a winning artist of the Klompching Gallery Fresh Award and exhibition._"
