Here is What it Looks Like_**](https://jesserieser.com/collections/nytimes-reopen) for **_The New York Tim_es** was selected as one of the five finalists for The Agents Club ’22 Awards in the \"Poetic Documentary\" category. ⁠\n\nLast year I was part of a nationwide project documenting the reopening. Pictured here is the Arizona Balloon Festival in Goodyear, AZ.\n\nThis commission reflects many of my sensibilities seen in my long-term personal works. Here the ingredients of light, color, humor, candid action, and charming moments make up this uniquely American visual recipe.\n\nAs much as the larger project was a post-pandemic coming out party for America, I suppose it was mine too— my first time venturing into a mostly unmasked gathering in a place other than a grocery store or retail establishment.\n\nWith a photographer assigned to each state, the totality of the project reminded me of one of the first photo documentary books of memory, David Elliot Cohen and Rick Somlan’s 1986 _A Day In the Life of America._\n\n_The New York Times_-  \n\"After a year spent in lockdown, The New York Times sent photographers to all 50 American states — as well as D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico — to document what reopening looks like.\n\nFrom the beginning, the U.S. had a patchwork response to the coronavirus. Conflicting guidance from federal, state and local governments often left communities, businesses and individuals to navigate their own way through competing public health and economic crises.\n\nAs states began to announce reopenings in March, we documented each state’s unique re-emergence from the pandemic. The approach to reopening has been much the same: unclear guidance, competing narratives and Americans left to gauge their own comfort levels. Some have taken these first steps cautiously. But many scenes recall a world untouched by a deadly virus.”"
