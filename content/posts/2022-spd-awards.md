content = "Excited to learn that my [**_Barron’s_**](https://jesserieser.com/collections/barrons-lasvegas) cover story _Fortunes Rise Anew in the City of Second Chances_⁠ was selected as a Merit Winner in the 2022 SPD (Society of Publication Designer) 57 awards.\n\n“Las Vegas is coming back to life.\n\nThe pandemic hit Las Vegas hard in March 2020. Gambling is often resilient during economic downturns, but it’s difficult to maintain business as usual when casinos are shut down for nearly three months.\n\nConvention business dried up, too. And with none of the buffets or signature shows open and lockdowns in place, leisure travel froze. Thousands of workers whose livelihood is tied to the 24/7 bustle of Sin City were suddenly out of work.\n\nNow, lifted by a surge of leisure travelers, Las Vegas is shaking off the pandemic’s grip and staging a comeback.⁠⁠\"\n\nThank you to jurors Joseph Hutchinson Creative Director of Rolling Stone, Nick Mrozzowski Creative Director of Hello Alice, Amy Feitelberg Art Director of Photography for Square, Robert Newman Creative Director This Old House, and [J](https://www.instagram.com/jarmus3/) Armus Creative Director of Jarmus Design. ⁠"
